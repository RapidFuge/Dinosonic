# Dinosonic

Dinosonic is a fast, lightweight music streaming server built with Deno,
inspired by the Subsonic API.

> [!NOTE]
> This implementation of the Subsonic and OpenSubsonic api is not 100% faithful and can include some minor differences, but the most important thing to note is that the project will not be following ALL the version api structure and only will follow the most recent version (1.16.1), of course it will not care for the "v" field since it will only respond with one version.

> [!NOTE]
> This software is still in its very early stages so everything will be in its roughest. Code will be cleaned after everything is working and complete.
